# Zombies
This is a simple browser game that I made for a university computer graphics course, where we used WebGL. It is a first-person zombie shooter.

Loading the textures requires that the game is running under a web server due to browser security restrictions. To do this is simple. In the base directory, run the command:

`python3 -m http.server 1340`

and then navigate to `localhost:1340` in your browser to play the game. The Python command starts the server, hosted on port 1340.
